<!-- ## Overview

This project is a Sudoku Solver implemented using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It provides an efficient solution to solve Sudoku puzzles programmatically.

## Features

-   Solves any valid Sudoku puzzle.
-   Implements backtracking, MRV, Forward Checking and Dancing Links algorithm for solving.
-   Validates Sudoku rules (row, column, and subgrid constraints).

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x or higher
-   Libraries: None (pure Python implementation)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lucietran03/SudokuSolver_DSAProject.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd SudokuSolver_DSAProject
    ```
3. Run the solver:
    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    java Main
    ``` -->
