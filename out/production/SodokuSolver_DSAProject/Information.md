# Sudoku Solver - DSA Project  

## Overview  

This project implements a Sudoku solver using the Dancing Links algorithm. The solver efficiently handles the exact cover problem, which is central to solving Sudoku puzzles, by leveraging the power of the Dancing Links technique.

## Technique Used: Dancing Links Algorithm  

The Dancing Links algorithm, also known as DLX, is an efficient method for solving exact cover problems. It is based on Donald Knuth's Algorithm X and uses a clever data structure to dynamically update and restore the state of the problem during the solving process.  

In the context of Sudoku:  
- Represent the Sudoku grid as an exact cover problem.  
- Use a sparse matrix to encode constraints (rows, columns, subgrids).  
- Solve the problem by iteratively selecting and removing rows and columns, backtracking when necessary.

## Implementation Details  

### Key Steps in the Algorithm:  
1. **Matrix Representation**: Encode the Sudoku grid as a sparse matrix representing constraints.  
2. **Cover and Uncover**: Dynamically update the matrix by covering and uncovering rows and columns during the solving process.  
3. **Recursive Search**: Use Algorithm X to recursively search for a solution.  
4. **Backtracking**: Restore the matrix state when a dead end is reached.

## Pseudocode  

```java  
public boolean solveSudoku(int[][] board) {  
    DancingLinks dlx = new DancingLinks(board);  
    return dlx.solve();  
}  

class DancingLinks {  
    // Initialize the data structure and constraints  
    public DancingLinks(int[][] board) {  
        // Implementation details  
    }  

    // Solve the exact cover problem  
    public boolean solve() {  
        // Recursive implementation of Algorithm X  
        return true;  
    }  
}  
```  

### Helper Functions:  
- `initializeMatrix(board)`: Converts the Sudoku grid into a sparse matrix representation.  
- `cover(row)`: Covers a row and its associated columns in the matrix.  
- `uncover(row)`: Restores a previously covered row and its columns.

## Advantages and Limitations  

### Advantages:  
- Highly efficient for solving exact cover problems.  
- Scales well for complex Sudoku puzzles.  

### Limitations:  
- Requires a deeper understanding of the Dancing Links data structure.  
- Implementation complexity is higher compared to basic backtracking.
